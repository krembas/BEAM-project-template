# Place for ansible inventory that defines BEAM environment (develop environment in this case).
#
# BEAM requires special convention - there must be groups that has
# same names as product components, that contains all hosts (or groups
# of hosts etc) related to given project component.
#
# Rest is just up to you - it's just old good plain ansible inventory...
#
# Example: Assume we have project with two project components named
# Backend & Frontend. Then example of simple environment can looks like:
#
# [Backend]
# postgres_db_host      ansible_host=<...>, ...
# backend_host          ansible_host=<...>, ...
#
# [Frontend]
# frontend_host         ansible_host=<...>, ...
